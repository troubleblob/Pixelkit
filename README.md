# Kano Pixel Kit
This is my attemp to connect Kano Pixel Kit to esphome. I added a text helper to the config file towrds bottom. The helper is used to pass text to the display. This code does not include the analog microphone pin (?) 3 maybe on analog knob. It does include the led matrix and 7 buttons. It makes a great wireless remot for home assistant.
